# Hardware:

1. Description:
- Battery/Charger: powers the system with a certain voltage
- HW-131: regulator for the ESP8266, and also a test for the components functionalities
- ESP8266: microcontroller where the code goes
- Voltage Divider: the analog sensor is not necessarily designed for this kit, thus the voltage should be normalized for A0
- Distance sensor: measures the distance by calculating time between sending and receiving wave
- OLED: the display where the number of people will be showed
- SD Card: used for storing information (extension of current features)

Flow: the system is charged, a person passes near the sensor, ADC generates an interruption, a voltage is recorded by A0, the value is
converted to a distance, and if the distance is in some interval, then increase the counter and display the number on the OLED.

2. Components list:
