# Description:
Mall Counter is a project that aims to count the number of people that entered a room using an analog sensor and the approximated time between sending wave and returning wave of some frequency.
This provides valuable information that can be used to measure the degree of agglomeration, optimize the staff at peak hours, assess which offers were attractive. In order to do that, a counter for the
people entering and a counter for the people leaving can be used to find the number of people in the room at a certain moment. I came with this idea after seeing at Parndorf Outlet that some shops have a
guard that limits the number of people in a shop to improve the customers experience. The project uses I2C, ADC and GPIO.
